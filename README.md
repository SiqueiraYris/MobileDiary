## Project Architecture

The project is structured based on the [MVVMC](https://www.runtastic.com/blog/en/mvvmc-adapting-the-mvvm-design-pattern-at-runtastic/) design pattern. The app is a set of modules each module is basically (but not necessary) a screen of the app. They are all located in the  `Scenes`  folder.
